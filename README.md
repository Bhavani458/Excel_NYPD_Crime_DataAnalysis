# NYPD Arrest Data Analysis

## 1. Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze NYPD's 2024 arrest data to:
- Enhance public safety by identifying trends in criminal activity.
- Optimize resource allocation by understanding borough-specific and time-based patterns.
- Improve operational efficiency and inform community-focused policies.

## 2. Key Questions Addressed
The analysis aimed to answer the following questions:

### Arrest Trends:
- How do arrest rates vary over time (daily and monthly)?
- Are specific days or times associated with higher arrest activity?

### Demographics Analysis:
- What is the distribution of arrests by perpetrator race and sex?
- How do arrests vary by age group and offense level?

### Offense-Specific Patterns:
- What are the top offenses driving arrests across NYC?
- How do specific offenses vary across boroughs?

### Jurisdiction Analysis:
- What percentage of arrests are handled by NYPD versus non-NYPD jurisdictions?
- How does the level of offense vary by jurisdiction type?

### Time-Based Patterns:
- Are there noticeable differences in arrest rates between weekdays and weekends?
- Do certain boroughs experience higher arrest rates on weekends?

## 3. How I Solved the Problems
To address the above questions, the following steps and skills were used:

### Tools and Techniques:
- **Data Visualization**: Designed **line charts**, **bar charts**, and **pie charts** to effectively communicate trends and insights from the data.
- **Advanced Excel Formulas**: Applied key data analysis functions like **XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, COUNTIFS,** and **TEXT()** to perform in-depth calculations and derive meaningful insights.
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Leveraged **DATE** formulas to extract and analyze time-based patterns, identifying trends across days, months, and weekdays versus weekends.
- **Interactive Charts:** Utilized **Pivot Tables** and **Slicers** to create dynamic and **interactive** charts, allowing for efficient filtering and exploration of arrest data.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Demonstrated proficiency with functions like **UNIQUE** to remove duplicates, **conditional formatting** to highlight key data points, and structured methodologies to clean and organize data.
- **Insightful Reporting**: Combined these skills to provide clear, actionable insights tailored to **solving real-world business** and operational problems.

### Problem-Solving Process:
- Extracted key trends such as peak arrest days and months.
- Examined demographic distributions by race, sex, and age groups.
- Analyzed borough-wise and jurisdiction-specific arrest patterns.
- Identified the top 5 offenses driving arrests across NYC.

## 4. Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations were made:
- **Allocate Resources Strategically**: Increase patrols on high-arrest days like Wednesdays and in high-activity boroughs like Brooklyn and Manhattan.
- **Address Offense-Specific Challenges**: Prioritize interventions for Assault 3 & Related Offenses and Petit Larceny.
- **Refine Strategies for High-Risk Groups**: Focus on males and younger age groups involved in misdemeanors and felonies.
- **Weekend Monitoring**: Maintain targeted coverage in Brooklyn and Manhattan despite lower arrest rates on weekends.
